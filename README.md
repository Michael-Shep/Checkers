# Checkers
Checkers Web Game created with React

This is my first completed React project and was mainly used to help understand the language, hence some of the code may not have been performed in the best way.

Currently, only a local 2 player mode is available - there is no AI for playing against a computer, but this is something that may be added in the future.

Not all the rules of checkers may be followed perfectly since as mentioned, the aim of this project was to create a working React app rather than implement a perfect Checkers clone.
